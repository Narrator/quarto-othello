# quarto-othello

Two popular board games written in Turbo C++.

# History
I wrote these two board games back in 2007 for my high school Computer Science Project. The Othello game even has a computer opponent! It's not full-fledged AI, but it's something :P.

# Build
I haven't touched this code base in 11 years, so once I figure out how to do it, this space will be updated :)
